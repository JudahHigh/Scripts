types of unique atoms in a molecular com file for Gaussian. Usefull for accounting
when dealing with large molecules on the order of hundreds or thousands of atoms,
the types of systems dealt with in my lab.

Use : Pass a Guassian input file (.com extension) as an argument to script

>> python num_types_atoms.py some_molecule.com

example output is shown below
