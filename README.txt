This directory contains some of the scripts that I have written during during
my PhD that have assisted in various aspects of my research. Many of these
scripts streamlined data processing, formatting and generation aspects of my
research.

Each sub-directory contains a script with a test case that can be run as well
as a README.txt that explains the purpose and use of the script. Only the
moVecAngle script does not have test case as the test input files are too
large to be uploaded to GitHub.
