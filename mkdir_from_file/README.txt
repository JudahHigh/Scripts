Title: mkdir_from_file.py
Author: Judah High

Description: This script simply makes a directory for a single input file
passed as an argument and places the file within the new directory within the
current working directory.

For example, if passed ./test.txt, the script will create the directory test
in the current working directory and place test.txt inside of it.

Use: Pass a file, not a directory, to the script

python mkdir_from_file.py test.txt
